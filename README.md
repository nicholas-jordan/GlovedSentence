Fixed Length Representations of Sentences and Documents

 The focus of this work is to represent texts of widely varying length as fixed-unit which handle degenerate cases as non-null Objects 
 
 Representations of Sentence / Paragraph / Document make for tangled code-developement challenges thus the reduction to a type-safe paradigm where an otherwise un-known Object can occur via Object.TYPE field of Java POJ
