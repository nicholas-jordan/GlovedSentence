Fixed Length Representations of Sentences and Documents

The focus of this work is to represent texts of widely varying length as fixed-unit which handle degenerate cases as non-null Objects. 
 
 Representations of Sentence / Paragraph / Document make for tangled code-developement challenges.
 
Thus the reduction to a type-safe paradigm where an otherwise un-known Object can occur via new with type-resolution via the Object.TYPE field of Java POJ by use of this.TYPE field provides for bridging from the String / Vector paradigm to paradigm where extant definition or accepted nomenclature do not restrict Set of Operations to enforce algorithm which may be effective in other domains making for an enroching of confused data-types by overloaded method calls.
